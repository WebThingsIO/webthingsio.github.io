      <p>The &quot;WebThings&quot; wordmark is a registered trademark owned by <a href="https://krellian.com">Krellian Ltd.</a> on behalf of the WebThings Community. For the purposes of this policy, &quot;WebThings&quot; is a trading name of Krellian Ltd.

      <section id="addons-guidelines">
        <h1>WebThings Gateway Add-on Guidelines</h1>
        <p>In addition to the guidelines above, your add-on developer name and everything about your add-on (including the add-on name, icon, description, graphics and screenshots) must be unique and free of WebThings trademarks unless:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You've received prior written permission from Krellian Ltd., or</li>
          <li>
            You're only using a WebThings wordmark to describe that your add-on works with WebThings Gateway and as long as your add-on icon and/or name:
            <ol>
              <li>Does not suggest or give the impression your add-on is actually published by, affiliated with or endorsed by WebThings; and</li>
              <li>Denotes your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by WebThings</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, you cannot name your add-on &quot;WebThings NewGadget Adapter&quot;. However, it would be acceptable to name your add-on &quot;NewGadget Adapter for WebThings Gateway&quot;.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="open-source-guidelines">
        <h1>Open Source Project Guidelines</h1>
        <p>The specific licence for each of the WebThings software projects and code says what you can and cannot do with the code itself but does not give permission to use WebThings trademarks. If you choose to build on or modify WebThings open source code for your own project,</p>
        <h2>You Must:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow the terms of the Open Source Licence(s) for WebThings software products and code.</li>
          <li>Choose branding, logos, and trademarks that denote your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement with WebThings.</li>
          <li>Follow the General Guidelines, above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>You Must NOT:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use any WebThings trademark in connection with the user-facing name or branding of your project.</li>
          <li>Use any WebThings trademark or any part of any WebThings trademark to incorrectly suggest or give the impression your software is actually published by, affiliated with, or endorsed by WebThings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, please do not name your project WebThings [Something].</p>
        <h2>You May:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>State in words (not using logos or images) that your product "works with" or "is compatible with" certain WebThings software products, if that is true.</li>
          <li>State in words (not using logos or images) that your project is based on WebThings open source technology, if that is true, as long as you also include a statement that your project is not officially associated with WebThings or its products.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For instance, you may state that your project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&quot;is proudly built using the WebThings Framework&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;is adapted from the open source WebThings Gateway&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>as long as you also include the statement equally prominently:
          &quot;[Brand Name] and [Product Name] are not officially associated with WebThings.&quot;
          </p>
      </section>

      <section id="social-media-guidelines">
        <h1>Social Media Guidelines</h1>
        <p>In addition to the General Guidelines above, the name and handle of your social media account and any and all pages cannot begin with a WebThings trademark. In addition, WebThings logos cannot be used in a way that might suggest affiliation with WebThings, including but not limited to, the account, profile, or header images. The only exception to these requirements is if you've received prior permission from Krellian Ltd.</p>
        <p>For example, you cannot name your account, page, or community &quot;WebThings Representatives&quot; or &quot;WebThings Software&quot;. However, it would be acceptable to name your account, page or community &quot;Fans of WebThings&quot; or &quot;Information about Webthings Software&quot; as long as you do not use the WebThings logos or otherwise suggest any affiliation with WebThings.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="cloud-based-services">
        <h1>Cloud-based Services</h1>
        <p>If you offer a cloud-based service that provides remote access to WebThings software, it is important that you do so in a way that does not confuse users about who is offering the service. You must not use WebThings trademarks in the name of your product or service.</p>
        <p>You may state in words (not using logos or images) that your product or service features or provides access to unaltered WebThings software, if this is true. For example,</p>
        <p>Acceptable: [Your Product Name] powered by WebThings Cloud</p>
        <p>Incorrect: [WebThings] [Your Product Name]</p>

        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="distribution-policy">
        <h1>Distribution Policy</h1>
        <p>What you can and cannot do with our software projects and code - independent of our trademarks - is governed by the relevant software licenses. For example, most WebThings code is released under the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/">Mozilla Public Licence version 2.0.</a></p>
        <p>The Mozilla Public Licence does not grant permission to use trademarks, as is set out in its section 2.1 &quot;Grants&quot;:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/">&quot;Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license: (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)…&quot;</blockquote>
        <p>In the following, the term &quot;WebThings software&quot; refers to software developed and/or distributed by WebThings or one of its affiliates. If you wish to distribute WebThings Gateway and other WebThings software branded with our trademarks, you must comply with the relevant software licenses, this WebThings Trademark Policy and either the Unaltered Software Distribution Policy or the terms of a written distribution agreement with Krellian Ltd.</p>
        <h2>Unaltered Software Distribution Policy</h2>
        <p>You may distributed unaltered copies of WebThings Gateway and other WebThings software from <a href="https://webthings.io">webthings.io</a> without express permission from Krellian Ltd. as long as you comply with the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You may not charge for the software. That means:
            <ul>
              <li>Distribution may not be subject to any fee.</li>
              <li>Distribution may not be tied to purchasing a product or service.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>You may not collect personal information in the context of your distribution of the software.</li>
          <li>You may not add to, remove, or change any part of the software, including the WebThings trademarks themselves. For example, you may not add any add-ons to WebThings Gateway or change default settings or config files.</li>
          <li>You may not modify the installation process of the software or use it to install any other add-ons or software.</li>
          <li>We suggest that if you want to distribute WebThings software, you do so by linking to official downloads at <a href="https://webthings.io">webthings.io</a> to help ensure safe, reliable downloads. For example, if you wish to directly distribute copies of WebThings Gateway yourself, you must distribute the latest stable version available at <a href="https://webthings.io/gateway">webthings.io/gateway</a>.</li>
          <li>When distributing you must distribute the most recent version of WebThings Gateway and other WebThings software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Krellian Ltd. reserves the right to change this Unaltered Software Distribution Policy by posting changes on this webpage.</p>
        <h2>Modified Versions Require Prior Written Permission</h2>
        <p>The open source nature of WebThings Gateway and other WebThings software allows you to freely download and modify the source code. However, if you make any changes to WebThings Gateway or other WebThings software, you may not redistribute that product using any WebThings trademark without Krellian Ltd.'s prior written consent and, typically, a distribution agreement with Krellian Ltd. For example, you may not distribute a modified form of WebThings Gateway and continue to call it WebThings Gateway.</p>
        <p>Changes requiring Krellian Ltd.'s prior written permission include (but are not limited to):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Adding, modifying, or deleting source files</li>
          <li>Adding, modifying, or deleting content from installer files,</li>
          <li>File location changes, or</li>
          <li>Adding or removing adapter, notifier, extension or other types of add-ons</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Branding Guidelines</h1>
        <h2>WebThings</h2>
        <p>(upper camel case, <em>without</em> a space between “Web” and “Things”)</p>
        <p>The WebThings platform is an open source implementation of the Web of Things (see below). This includes sub-components such as &quot;WebThings Gateway&quot;, &quot;WebThings Framework&quot; and &quot;WebThings Cloud&quot;.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/webthings_logos.png" width="512px"/>
          <figcaption>Example WebThings logos incorporating the WebThings wordmark</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ul>
          <li>The main WebThings logo includes the WebThings wordmark rendered in the Semi-Bold Zilla Slab typeface and may be used alone or as part of a lockup including the WebThings icon to the left as shown above. </li>
          <li>The logos of WebThings sub-components are rendered with the name of the subcomponent in the Regular Zilla Slab typeface, and may also be used alone or as part of a lockup including the WebThings icon to the left as shown above.</li>
          <li>Logos of WebThings sub-components including both the wordmark and icon in a lockup should feature the subcomponent name underneath &quot;WebThings&quot; as shown above.</li>
          <li>Logos of WebThings sub-components without the WebThings icon should include the sub-component name to the right of "WebThings", with a space between the two as shown above.</li>
          <li>The wordmark portion of WebThings logos should be rendered in black on light backgrounds and in white on dark backgrounds.</li>
          <li>Modification of the colours of the WebThings icon should be avoided, so in general logo versions without the icon should be used on very dark backgrounds where the icon would not be clearly visible.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>WebThings is a proper noun and brand name which should not be localised.</p>
        <p>A connected device may be referred to as &quot;powered by WebThings&quot; (if it adheres to the terms of this trademark policy), but it should never be referred to as &quot;a WebThing&quot;. It should instead always be referred to as &quot;a web thing&quot; (see below).</p>
        <h2>web thing</h2>
        <p>(lowercase, <em>with</em> a space between web and thing)</p>
        <p>A device connected to the Web of Things (see below). Like &quot;web page&quot; or &quot;website&quot;, but for devices rather than documents. &quot;web thing&quot; is a common noun and may be localised.</p>
        <p>No formal certification exists to determine whether a given device is or is not a &quot;web thing&quot;. There is therefore no single authority who can enforce conditions on the use of this term.</p>
        <p>However, from the point of view of the WebThings Community the term "web thing" refers to a connected device which:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Has a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">W3C WoT Thing Description</a> accessible via a URL on the World Wide Web</li>
          <li>Can be monitored and/or controlled over a web protocol (e.g. HTTP, WebSockets or CoAP)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Web of Things</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> is an application layer which runs on top of the Internet of Things in the same way that the World Wide Web is an application layer on top of the Internet. It refers to the worldwide network of web things using Web of Things standards, which are not limited to any single vendor. It may be written in lowercase &quot;web of things&quot; but is more commonly written as &quot;Web of Things&quot; or abbreviated as &quot;WoT&quot;.</p>
        <p>The open source WebThings platform is just one implementation of Web of Things standards in the same way that Apache is one implementation of a web server and Firefox is one implementation of a web client.</p>
        <p>Usage of the term &quot;Web of Things&quot; is not limited in any way by this policy.</p>
